##Synopsis
Using the Arduino Programming Language this repo contains a morse code library and an example of how to implement the library to make lights blink.

##Motivation
As with most Arduino projects, the answer is "why not!?". This project led my co-builder [Brooke Dukes](https://github.com/BandonRandon) and I to write our first Arduino Library! One of the best things about working on fun projects like this is the amount of creative problem solving that really fuels a collorative atmosphere.
